# BoxOfficeSuccess
For major film studios such as Marvel and DC, predicting the box office success of upcoming movies is critical for strategic planning, budgeting, marketing, and resource allocation. Accurate predictions can help studios optimize promotional strategies, plan sequels, and make informed financial decisions. This can be helpful for future filmmakers as well as the businesses mentioned in exactly what would be necessary for a successful superhero movie.

By understanding the factors that contribute to a movie's success, these studios can improve their decision-making processes and maximize profitability. The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the box office revenue of Marvel and DC movies from 1978 until 2024. This model will consider various features such as budget, release date, distributor, box office gross, critic scores, as well as other variables for evaluation. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help Marvel and DC studios strategize more effectively for future movie releases. The target variable for the model will be the box office gross worldwide of a movie.

The data for this project has been obtained through Kaggle, with the link listed below, where the included dataset contains attributes for gross income, budget, and other variables that will be helpful in our analysis of this dataset. 

Within this analysis, we can determine what truly can be achieved and can help future filmmakers focusing within the superhero genre make data-driven decisions, while understanding how the industry should be moving towards optimization with their strategies to maximize the profitability of the films. Below are the different graphs that were requested within this document, and they will be labeled with how this can be seen and followed up upon.
